# Popular-Movies-Stage-2
Android Developer Nanodegree - Project 3 - Popular Movies Stage 2

## Project Overview
Welcome back to Popular Movies! In this second and final stage, you’ll add additional functionality to the app you built in Stage 1.

## You’ll add more information to your movie details view:
- You’ll allow users to view and play trailers (either in the youtube app or a web browser).
- You’ll allow users to read reviews of a selected movie.
- You’ll also allow users to mark a movie as a favorite in the details view by tapping a button (star).
- You'll make use of Android Architecture Components (Room, LiveData, ViewModel and Lifecycle) to create a robust an efficient application.
- You'll create a database using Room to store the names and ids of the user's favorite movies (and optionally, the rest of the information needed to display their favorites collection while offline).
- You’ll modify the existing sorting criteria for the main view to include an additional pivot to show their favorites collection.
